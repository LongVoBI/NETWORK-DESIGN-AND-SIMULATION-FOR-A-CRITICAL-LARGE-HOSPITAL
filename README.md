# Network Design and Simulation for a Large Hospital

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to serve as second  assignment project for a Computer Networks course from Semester 1 of the 2023-2024 academic year. It focuses on the design and simulation of a network for a critical large hospital.

## Analysis of Repository Contents
The repository appears to be related to network design and simulation, as suggested by its title and context. Since there is limited information available in the README file, analyzing the repository's contents directly would provide better insights into the specific features and technologies used. 

Typically, such projects might include:
- üìÑ **[Documents]()**: Additional documentation detailing and requirement the network design and methodology.
- üìä **[Report]()**: A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and results of the network simulation.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **[Build](https://github.com/LongVoBi37/NETWORK-DESIGN-AND-SIMULATION-FOR-A-CRITICAL-LARGE-HOSPITAL/blob/8fb8986526d2acac7fb74bab8f94a8a5898632ad/build/ComputerNetworkAssignment2.pkt)**: Files and settings for network simulations.
