# Network Design and Simulation for a Large Hospital

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to serve as an assignment project for a Computer Networks course from Semester 1 of the 2023-2024 academic year. It focuses on the design and simulation of a network for a critical large hospital. The README file provides minimal information, mainly reiterating the assignment's title and course details.

## Analysis of Repository Contents
The repository appears to be related to network design and simulation, as suggested by its title and context. Since there is limited information available in the README file, analyzing the repository's contents directly would provide better insights into the specific features and technologies used. 

Typically, such projects might include:
- üó∫Ô∏è **Network Topology Diagrams**: Visual representations of the network design.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Simulation Configurations**: Files and settings for network simulations.
- üíª **Code for Network Simulations**: Implementations using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.

Further examination of the repository files and directories would be necessary to provide a detailed analysis of the specific technologies and methodologies employed.
