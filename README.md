# Network Design and Simulation for a Large Hospital

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to serve as an assignment project for a Computer Networks course from Semester 1 of the 2023-2024 academic year. It focuses on designing a topology of a network for a critical large company, where different departments have computers in various buildings. The goal is to set up a network that allows these departments to interact and communicate with each other by exchanging data.

## Analysis of Repository Contents
