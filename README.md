# Network Design and Simulation for a Large Hospital

## Purpose of This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to serve as second  assignment project for a Computer Networks course from Semester 1 of the 2023-2024 academic year. It focuses on the design and simulation of a network for a critical large hospital.

## Analysis of Repository Contents
The repository appears to be related to network design and simulation, as suggested by its title and context.
